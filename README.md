## Code Review

#### By [Dante Mogrim](https://github.com/mogrim-91)

- [ ] <strong>1.</strong>Are you using Prettier? Looks like some files would do good by some added structure.
- [ ] <strong>2.</strong>The “Your Submissions” url is broken under "My Profile".
- [ ] <strong>3.</strong>Would be nice to give the articles the `target=“_blank”` HTML attribute, so that they still stay at your site while reading outside content.
- [ ] <strong>4.</strong>Not possible to change ones password atm. 
- [ ] <strong>5.</strong>Not able to create a post atm.
- [ ] <strong>6.</strong>Would be nice to be able to change ones profile picture.
- [ ] <strong>7.</strong>The “Delete Account” url is broken under "My Profile".
- [ ] <strong>8.</strong>When you want to fetch multiple rows from your database fetchAll will be a good friend to you. 
- [ ] <strong>9.</strong>Comments are currently missing.
- [ ] <strong>10.</strong>To keep track of your users, make sure they get an individual id in the database. Currently it’s unfortunately showing “null”.
